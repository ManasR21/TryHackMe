# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) Summary

## Task 1: What is an IDOR?
**IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)** is a type of access control vulnerability where an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly without proper authorization checks. This allows attackers to bypass access controls and view or modify data belonging to other users.

---

## Task 2: An IDOR Example
A common example of IDOR:
```
GET /user/profile?user_id=123
```
If a user modifies `user_id=123` to `user_id=124` and can access another user's profile without authorization, it's an IDOR vulnerability.

---

## Task 3: Finding IDORs in Encoded IDs
Encoded IDs (e.g., Base64) can be easily decoded by attackers. If no access control is enforced after decoding, IDOR exists:
```
GET /user/profile?id=MTIz (Base64 for 123)
```
Decode and test variations to find unauthorized access.

---

## Task 4: Finding IDORs in Hashed IDs
Hashed IDs (e.g., MD5, SHA1) may seem secure but can be brute-forced or guessed if predictable:
```
GET /invoice?ref=202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70 (MD5 for "123")
```
Try known values or precomputed hashes to find valid objects.

---

## Task 5: Finding IDORs in Unpredictable IDs
Unpredictable IDs like UUIDs are harder to brute-force, but IDORs can still exist if no proper authorization checks are implemented:
```
GET /files/4f9d27e8-0d4c-4e98-a394-95d2391c89f1
```
Check for access control flaws even if IDs are random.

---

## Task 6: Where are IDORs Located?
IDOR vulnerabilities can appear in:
- URL parameters
- POST request bodies
- Cookies
- HTTP headers (e.g., `X-User-ID`)
- Hidden form fields

Always verify access controls at the server side, regardless of where the ID is received from.
