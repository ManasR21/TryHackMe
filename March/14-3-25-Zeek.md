# Zeek Guide  

## Task 1: Introduction  

Zeek (formerly Bro) is an open-source and commercial network monitoring tool (traffic analyzer).  

### Official Description:  
*"Zeek (formerly Bro) is the world's leading platform for network security monitoring. Flexible, open-source, and powered by defenders."*  

*"Zeek is a passive, open-source network traffic analyzer. Many operators use Zeek as a network security monitor (NSM) to support suspicious or malicious activity investigations. Zeek also supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks beyond the security domain, including performance measurement and troubleshooting."*  

The purpose of this guide is to provide a general overview of network monitoring and demonstrate how to work with Zeek to investigate captured traffic.  

### Prerequisites:  
- **Basic Linux familiarity**  
- **Networking fundamentals** (ports, protocols, and traffic data)  

*It is recommended to complete the "Network Fundamentals" path before working with Zeek in-depth.*  

---

## Task 2: Network Security Monitoring and Zeek  

Network monitoring involves observing and optionally recording network traffic for detecting and addressing issues.  

- **Network Monitoring** focuses on performance, uptime, and configuration, aiding network administrators but not directly tackling security threats.  
- **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)** targets detecting anomalies like rogue hosts, malicious traffic, and security vulnerabilities. Itâ€™s integral to Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and supports incident response.  

Zeek is a **passive, open-source tool** for network traffic analysis. It produces detailed logs for forensic and data analysis tasks, supporting over **50+ logs** in seven categories.  

### Zeek vs. Snort  
- **Zeek**: Better for in-depth traffic analysis and complex threat detection.  
- **Snort**: Ideal for detecting known threats via signature-based detection.  

### Zeek Architecture  
1. **Event Engine**: Processes packets and identifies protocols.  
2. **Policy Script Interpreter**: Analyzes and correlates events using scripts.  
3. **Frameworks**: Zeek includes multiple frameworks like Logging, Input, Intelligence, and Signature to extend functionality.  

### Zeek Outputs  
- Default log storage: `/opt/zeek/logs/`  
- When analyzing PCAP files: Logs are stored in the current working directory.  

### Running Zeek  
- **As a service** using `zeekctl`:  
  ```bash
  zeekctl deploy      # Deploy the current configuration
  zeekctl status      # Check Zeek's current status
  zeekctl start       # Start Zeek service
  zeekctl stop        # Stop Zeek service
  ```



## Task 3: Zeek Logs  

Zeek generates **structured, tab-separated ASCII log files** for every network connection, covering application-level protocols and fields. It can identify over **50+ log types**, categorized into **seven main categories**:  

### Log Categories  
1. **Network**: Logs for various protocols (e.g., `conn.log`, `http.log`, `dns.log`, `ssl.log`).  
2. **Files**: Logs for file analysis results (e.g., `files.log`, `pe.log`).  
3. **NetControl**: Logs related to network flow and control (e.g., `netcontrol.log`).  
4. **Detection**: Logs for indicators and detections (e.g., `intel.log`, `notice.log`).  
5. **Network Observations**: Summarizes known hosts and services (e.g., `known_hosts.log`).  
6. **Miscellaneous**: Additional external alerts and failure logs (e.g., `weird.log`).  
7. **Zeek Diagnostic**: System diagnostics and statistics logs (e.g., `stats.log`).  

### Key Points  
- Each session has a unique **UID (Unique Identifier)** to correlate events.  
- **Daily Logs** (like `known_hosts.log`, `known_services.log`) track consistent network behaviors.  
- **Per-Session Logs** (like `notice.log`, `intel.log`) capture session-specific anomalies.  

### Overall Investigation Approach  
1. **Overall Info**: Start with general traffic logs like `conn.log` and `files.log`.  
2. **Protocol-Based**: Dive deeper using specific logs like `http.log` or `dns.log`.  
3. **Detection**: Focus on `notice.log` and `signatures.log` to identify anomalies.  
4. **Observation**: Summarize with logs like `known_hosts.log` and `software.log`.  

### Log Processing Tools  
- **Basic Linux Commands**:  
  - `cat`, `cut`, `grep`, `sort`, `uniq` for general log reading and filtering.  
- **zeek-cut**: Specialized tool for extracting specific fields from Zeek logs.  

#### Example Usage  
- Extract specific fields from `conn.log`:  
  ```bash
  cat conn.log | zeek-cut uid proto id.orig_h id.orig_p id.resp_h id.resp_p
  ```

### âœ… Key Takeaways for Zeek Log Analysis  

- `zeek-cut` is essential for extracting specific columns efficiently. Always check available fields with `cat` first.  
- Use `grep` to quickly filter relevant information.  
- `awk` and `sed` are powerful for line-specific manipulations.  
- Combine tools like `grep`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `cut` for advanced filtering and processing.  
- Use `less -S` for a better viewing experience when data spans wide columns.  





## Task 5: Zeek Signatures

# Zeek Signatures

Zeek supports signatures for rule creation and event correlation to detect noteworthy activities on the network. Unlike Snort rules, Zeek signatures are not the primary event detection point. Zeek also includes a robust scripting language that can chain multiple events to derive deeper insights. This document focuses on Zeek signatures, while scripting will be covered separately.

## Structure of Zeek Signatures

A Zeek signature comprises three key components:

1. **Signature ID**: A unique identifier for the signature.
2. **Conditions**:
    - **Header**: Filters based on packet headers (e.g., source/destination IPs, protocols, ports).
    - **Content**: Filters based on packet payloads or specific data patterns.
3. **Action**:
    - **Default Action**: Logs matches in the `signatures.log` file.
    - **Additional Action**: Triggers a custom Zeek script.

### Common Conditions and Filters

| Condition Field | Available Filters |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Header**     | `src-ip`, `dst-ip`, `src-port`, `dst-port`, `ip-proto` (TCP, UDP, ICMP, ICMP6, IP, IP6) |
| **Content**    | `payload`, `http-request`, `http-request-header`, `http-request-body`, `http-reply-header`, `http-reply-body`, `ftp` |
| **Context**    | `same-ip` (to filter identical source and destination addresses) |
| **Action**     | `event` (defines the message upon a signature match) |

### Comparison Operators
- `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
- Filters can accept strings, numerics, or regex values.

## Running Zeek with Signature Files

```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r sample.pcap -s sample.sig
```
- `.sig`: Signature file extension.
- `-C`: Ignore checksum errors.
- `-r`: Read from a pcap file.
- `-s`: Specify the signature file.

## Example 1: Detecting Cleartext Password Submissions

**Sample Signature:**
```zeek
signature http-password {
    ip-proto == tcp
    dst-port == 80
    payload /.*password.*/
    event "Cleartext Password Found!"
}
```
- Detects cleartext passwords in HTTP traffic.
- Logs matches to `signatures.log` and `notice.log`.

**Running the Signature:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r http.pcap -s http-password.sig
```

**Sample Log Analysis:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log | zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h msg
10.10.57.178 44.228.249.3 10.10.57.178: Cleartext Password Found!
```

## Example 2: Detecting FTP Admin Login Attempts

**Sample Signature:**
```zeek
signature ftp-admin {
    ip-proto == tcp
    dst-port == 21
    ftp /.*admin.*/
    event "FTP Admin Login Attempt!"
}
```
- Detects FTP login attempts with usernames containing "admin".

**Running the Signature:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-admin.sig
```

**Log Analysis:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat signatures.log | zeek-cut src_addr dst_addr event_msg sub_msg
10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 10.234.125.254: FTP Admin Login Attempt! USER admin
```

## Optimizing for FTP Brute-Force Detection

**Enhanced Signature:**
```zeek
signature ftp-brute-force {
    ip-proto == tcp
    dst-port == 21
    payload /530 Login incorrect/
    event "FTP Brute-force Attempt!"
}
```
- Detects failed FTP login attempts.

**Merging Signatures for Comprehensive Detection:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat ftp-admin.sig ftp-brute-force.sig > ftp-detection.sig
```

**Running the Merged Signature:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ zeek -C -r ftp.pcap -s ftp-detection.sig
```

**Analyzing Correlated Events:**
```bash
ubuntu@ubuntu$ cat notice.log | zeek-cut uid id.orig_h id.resp_h msg sub | nl
1001 CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 FTP Username Input Found! USER admin
1002 CeMYiaHA6AkfhSnd 10.234.125.254 10.121.70.151 FTP Brute-force Attempt! 530 Login incorrect.
```

## Snort Rules in Zeek?

Historically, Zeek (formerly Bro) supported Snort rules using the `snort2bro` converter. However, this is no longer supported in modern Zeek versions. Custom signatures must be written directly in Zeek's syntax.

## Conclusion

Zeek signatures provide robust mechanisms to detect network anomalies and potential attacks. However, excessive signature logging can lead to alert fatigue. Therefore, it's crucial to design optimized, relevant, and context-aware signatures.

For deeper insights into Zeek's scripting capabilities and advanced configurations, refer to Zeek's [official documentation](https://docs.zeek.org).


## Further Tasks

# Zeek Scripts

Zeek scripts extend the platform's capabilities, allowing for customized detection, logging, and response behaviors.

## Fundamentals

- Zeek scripts are written in the Zeek scripting language.
- Scripts are event-driven, reacting to network activities in real time.
- Scripts can be loaded automatically or manually via the `zeek` command.

**Basic Script Structure:**
```zeek
event zeek_init() {
    print("Zeek is starting up!");
}

event connection_established(c: connection) {
    print(fmt("Connection established between %s and %s", c$id$orig_h, c$id$resp_h));
}
```

## Scripts and Signatures
- Zeek scripts can be triggered by signatures to perform custom actions.
- Example: Triggering a script upon signature detection.

```zeek
redef signature_match_action += {
    ["http-password"] = function(match: signature_match) {
        print(fmt("Alert: Cleartext password detected from %s", match$src_addr));
    }
};
```

## Frameworks

Zeek provides multiple frameworks for extended functionality:
- **Notice Framework**: For generating and managing alerts.
- **Logging Framework**: For flexible and structured logging.
- **Input Framework**: For importing external data into Zeek.
- **Cluster Framework**: For managing Zeek clusters across distributed systems.

## Packages

- Zeek packages extend its functionalities and can be installed using the **Zeek Package Manager (ZKG)**.

**Basic Commands:**
```bash
zkg install <package-name>    # Install a package
zkg list                      # List installed packages
zkg remove <package-name>     # Remove a package
```

**Commonly Used Packages:**
- `zeek/zeek-community-id`: Generates community ID hashes for network flows.
- `zeek/zeek-geoip`: Adds geographical information to IP addresses.
