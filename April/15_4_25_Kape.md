# KAPE Forensics 

## Task 2: Introduction to KAPE

**KAPE (Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor)** is a powerful tool used in Windows forensics to quickly collect and process forensic artifacts. It is portable and can be run from USB or network locations without installation.

- **Main Functions:**
  - **Collect Files** (Targets)
  - **Process Files** (Modules)

- **Targets** specify which artifacts to collect.
- **Modules** define how to process the collected data.

**Collection Mechanism:**
- Two-pass file copy (normal copy â†’ raw disk access for locked files)
- Preserves timestamps and structure

**Example Use Case:**  
Collect prefetch files and process them using **PECmd** module to extract information.

**Executable Types:**
- `kape.exe`: Command-line interface (CLI)
- `gkape.exe`: Graphical User Interface (GUI)

**Answer 2.1:** `gkape.exe`

---

## Task 3: Target Options

- **Targets** are defined with `.tkape` files.
- These files include artifact paths, categories, and file masks.

**Types of Targets:**
- **Basic Targets:** Collect a single artifact (e.g., Prefetch).
- **Compound Targets:** Combine multiple Targets for easier collection.

**Useful Directories:**
- `!Disabled`: Inactive Targets
- `!Local`: Custom Targets not synced with GitHub

**Answer 3.1:** `.tkape`  
**Answer 3.2:** `Compound Target`

---

## Task 4: Module Options

- **Modules** are defined with `.mkape` files.
- They run executables/scripts on collected artifacts to generate results (e.g., `.csv`, `.txt`).

**Structure of a Module:**
- Specifies executable, arguments, output format, and export filename.

**bin Directory:**
- Contains executables not present on the system (e.g., Eric Zimmerman's tools).

**Answer 4.1:** `.mkape`  
**Answer 4.2:** `bin`

**Answer:** %d

**5.4** What option needs to be checked to add machine information to the triage folder name?  
**Answer:** %m

## Task 6: KAPE CLI

**6.1** What variable adds the collection timestamp to the target destination?  
**Answer:** %d

**6.2** What variable adds the machine information to the target destination?  
**Answer:** %m

**6.3** Which switch can be used to show debug information during processing?  
**Answer:** debug

**6.4** Which switch is used to list all targets available?  
**Answer:** tlist

**6.5** Which flag, when used with batch mode, will delete the _kape.cli, targets and modules files after the execution is complete?  
**Answer:** cu
