# Malware Analysis Summary

## Malware
Malware (malicious software) is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. It includes various types such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and rootkits.

## Techniques of Malware Analysis
Malware analysis is the process of studying malware to understand its behavior, origin, and impact. It can be classified into:
- **Static Analysis**: Inspecting the binary without execution.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Running the malware in a controlled environment to observe behavior.
- **Hybrid Analysis**: Combination of both static and dynamic techniques.

## Basic Static Analysis
Basic static analysis involves examining the malware binary without executing it. Common methods include:
- Checking file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256)
- Examining strings in the binary
- Reviewing file metadata
- Identifying suspicious imports and exports
- Using tools like `strings`, `PEiD`, and `Dependency Walker`

## The PE File Header
The Portable Executable (PE) file format is used for executables in Windows. Key components of the PE header include:
- **DOS Header**: Legacy MS-DOS compatibility.
- **NT Header**: Signature, file header, and optional header.
- **Section Headers**: Define code, data, resources, etc.
Understanding the PE structure helps identify injected code and suspicious behavior.

## Basic Dynamic Analysis
This technique involves executing malware in a sandbox or VM to monitor its actions. Techniques include:
- Observing process behavior
- Monitoring file system and registry changes
- Tracking network activity
- Using tools like `Process Monitor`, `Wireshark`, and `Procmon`

## Anti-analysis Techniques
Malware often uses evasion techniques to avoid detection and hinder analysis:
- **Code obfuscation**
- **Packing and encryption**
- **Debugger detection**
- **Anti-VM techniques**
- **API hooking or redirection**

## Conclusion
Understanding and analyzing malware requires both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practice. A combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques, along with familiarity with PE structure and evasion tactics, equips analysts to effectively dissect and respond to malware threats.
